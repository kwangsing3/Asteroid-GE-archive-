# Asteroid-GameEngine
It's for learning how to make my own game engine, recently work on cmake branch.

Why Asteroid?
Every single games, they all made for their goal, for funny or for challenge, the similar type of game will close together.
so I descripted the game just like an asteroid, when the games made by Asteroid-GameEngine become more and more, they will become asteroid belt.
After that, when we look back the Asteroid-GameEngine history, that will be attractive and wonderful universe landscape.
